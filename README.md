# Profilier
## Task
Develop a simple program that requests the user's name and puts this information in a text file.
If such a full name is in the file, then issue a message about it.
After entering the information, the program must complete the work and inform the user about the limits of its use (time or number of starts).
After reaching the launch limit, the program must invite the user to purchase a full version of it or uninstall himself.
When reinstalling the program, it must report its previous presence on this computer and check against past usage limits (i.e. do not give them in total).
